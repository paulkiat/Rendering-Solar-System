# Rendering Solar System

A graded assignment to create a solar system using p5.js with the following features:

## Features
1. **Earth Orbit:**
   - Create an Earth orbiting the Sun at 300 pixels, rotating around its axis.

2. **Earth's Moon:**
   - Add a Moon orbiting the Earth, spinning in the opposite direction of Earth's rotation.

3. **Sun's Rotation:**
   - Animate the Sun to spin on its axis.

## Development Steps
- **Earth:**
  - Create an Earth with color blue and size 80.
  - Rotate the Earth around the Sun at speed.

- **Earth's Moon:**
  - Add a white Moon (size 30) orbiting the Earth at 100 pixels.
  - Rotate the Moon around the Earth at `-speed*2`.

- **Sun Rotation:**
  - Make the Sun spin on its axis at `speed/3`.

## Bonus Features
- Add additional celestial bodies, such as:
  - A second moon orbiting Earth.
  - An asteroid orbiting the Moon.

## Grading
A detailed rubric assesses each feature, with a total score based on feature completion and additional development efforts.

## Usage
1. **Run the Template:**
   - Start by running the `solarSystemTEMPLATE` sketch using your preferred p5 editor.

2. **Development Steps:**
   - Follow the steps outlined to implement the solar system features.
